    <h2>Deploying Rails in 2022</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-14</h4>

    <p><br>I've played with the idea of moving my personal website to a non-static setup for a while (currently, it's hosted on Github pages), but inertia and lack of a key use case has prevented me from making the switch.<br><br>Fortunately, inspiration struck when my dad decided to run a March Madness pool this year! Sure, I could help him administer it via ESPN.com or the like, but I thought I'd seize the opportunity to build a little site that will allow people to submit and view their (and others) brackets. <br><br>Hoping to learn a few things in the process:<br>(1) Generally what a Rails stack looks like in 2022 - where are things run? What services are necessary? What are unnecessary?<br>(2) How does DNS work? My mental model of DNS right now is disconnected from the reality of A records, C records, etc. (the abstractions that actually are modified to make changes)<br>(3) How quickly will this take initially? How long would spinning up a project like this take with this experience?<br></p>

    <h2>LabScript!</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-14</h4>

    <p><br>Accompanying the kickoff of these notes are the language that powers them - LabScript! I wrote it as a very very simple markdown (up?) language that I can compile to HTML. The Github page describing the language in more detail (along with a Ruby parser implementation) can be found here [0].<br><br>As of this post, it supports 3 kinds of content blocks:<br>- Text<br>- Code Blocks<br>- Photos<br><br>Alternatives considered:<br>- Jekyll (markdown files -> HTML): this is probably the right choice - but it felt heavy to be honest. I didn't want to deal with writing pure markdown in Vim (too many seductive tools for viewing / editing). <br>- Writing raw HTML: also would work but too much cognitive load. <br>- Blogger / WordPress / choose-your-own-blog-service: I was concerned I wouldn't understand the abstractions from first principles, or that by the time I did they'd have shifted significantly under my feet. Also, would have to convert my static site onto some kind of hosted service.<br><br>Next steps will be adding footnote support to the Text content block - also may write a LabScript parser in OCaml / some functional language as a nice contrast to my hacky implementation in Ruby. <br><br>[0] github link here<br></p>

    <h2>Lab notes kickoff</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-14</h4>

    <p><br>Kicking off my lab notebook with this post. This was inspired by Nelson Elhage's insight that [0], unlike other scientists, many (most?) software engieers don't keep lab notebooks. Also Andy Mustuchak's notion of "working with the garage door up." [1]<br><br>I'm writing this collection of notes for my own consumption - the words "I don't know" will be constant, and most posts will be of works in progress. It's also going to force me to write the words - which is something I definitely need to improve<br><br>Cheers! <br><br>[0] link to post here<br>[1] link to post here<br></p>
