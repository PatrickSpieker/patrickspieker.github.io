    <h2>The Rails Project - Part 2</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-23</h4>

    <p><br>I've modified things slightly - probably not going to host this on RonSpieker.com, but the idea will be similar. <br><br>Starting off - I'm going to create a Droplet on DigitalOcean, and kick off a little web-server running on it. <br><br>First, I'm going to use SSH to connect to it, so I need to give DigitalOcean my SSH public key. It'll be on Debian.<br><br>Yay! It's working:<br></p><img src="assets/its_working.png"><p><br>Found this [0] tutorial which is helpful as well. Created a new user, and added that user to the sudo group. <br><br>Next is creating a firewall (oooooooo). The tutorial calls for "ufw":<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
apt install ufw

    </code></pre>
    <p>Then, we go ahead and allow OpenSSH (a preconfigured set of rules) thru the firewall with:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
ufw enable OpenSSH

    </code></pre>
    <p>Finally we enable the firewall:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
ufw enable

    </code></pre>
    <p><br>Next - we want to be able to SSH into our other user, so we add our SSH public key into our other user's (called memer) directory with:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
cp -r ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/memer/

    </code></pre>
    <p><br>Cool! Now on to actually installing Apache:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
sudo apt install apache2

    </code></pre>
    <p>Now opening just port 80 via the "WWW" firewall rule:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
sudo ufw allow WWW

    </code></pre>
    <p><br>Apparently, when the install exits, Apache starts? And we can use the systemctl command to check its status:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
sudo systemctl status apache2

    </code></pre>
    <p>This shows it as running!<br><br>Now - going to try to hit the server by going to the IP. <br><br>YAYYY! It works:<br></p><img src="assets/apache_landing.png"><p><br>[0] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-debian-10<br></p>

    <h2>RonSpieker.com - The Rails Project - Part 1</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-16</h4>

    <p><br>Starting work on the project! Step 1 - get _something_ deployed end to end so it's reachable on www.ronspieker.com - then go from there and iterate. This part may be more about DNS than about Rails.<br><br>So I've purchase ronspieker.com, and what I want is:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
# Go to ronspieker.com
# See a custom index.html page that's on my Digital Ocean droplet

    </code></pre>
    <p><br>Digging through Digital Ocean's documentation, I found this [0]:<br>> DNS is what allows you to direct a domain name to the web server hosting that domain’s content, for example.<br><br>But I don't think I need to actually use Digital Ocean's domain management - I should be able to just point easyDNS's control panel to the correct server. Reading from a blog post on Digital Ocean's forums (with an answer from a Digital Ocean employee):<br>>  If you’re using external nameservers (different from ns1.digitalocean.com) you need to make the DNS change from where you active DNS zone is. This can be your registrar or any other hosting provider you use as well.<br>> Your droplet IP will not be changed, so you can safely create an A record in the registrar’s DNS panel.<br><br>Great! So the steps here look like:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
    
# Spin up a droplet
# Figure out how to start a webserver on it
# Test out hitting the raw IP
# Use the easyDNS website to create an A record pointing ronspieker.com to the droplet's IP

    </code></pre>
    <p><br>Now I'm curious as how to start a web server on the droplet. Reading the tutorial here [2] - seems to be exactly what I want to do; covers most of the steps above. <br><br><br>[0] https://docs.digitalocean.com/tutorials/dns-registrars/<br>[1] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-point-dns-to-droplet<br>[2] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-rails-app-with-passenger-and-apache-on-ubuntu-14-04<br></p>

    <h2>Deploying Rails in 2022</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-14</h4>

    <p><br>I've played with the idea of moving my personal website to a non-static setup for a while (currently, it's hosted on Github pages), but inertia and lack of a key use case has prevented me from making the switch.<br><br>Fortunately, inspiration struck when my dad decided to run a March Madness pool this year! Sure, I could help him administer it via ESPN.com or the like, but I thought I'd seize the opportunity to build a little site that will allow people to submit and view their (and others) brackets. <br><br>Hoping to learn a few things in the process:<br>(1) Generally what a Rails stack looks like in 2022 - where are things run? What services are necessary? What are unnecessary?<br>(2) How does DNS work? My mental model of DNS right now is disconnected from the reality of A records, C records, etc. (the abstractions that actually are modified to make changes)<br>(3) How quickly will this take initially? How long would spinning up a project like this take with this experience?<br></p>

    <h2>LabScript!</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-14</h4>

    <p><br>Accompanying the kickoff of these notes are the language that powers them - LabScript! I wrote it as a very very simple markdown (up?) language that I can compile to HTML. The Github page describing the language in more detail (along with a Ruby parser implementation) can be found here [0].<br><br>As of this post, it supports 3 kinds of content blocks:<br>- Text<br>- Code Blocks<br>- Photos<br><br>Alternatives considered:<br>- Jekyll (markdown files -> HTML): this is probably the right choice - but it felt heavy to be honest. I didn't want to deal with writing pure markdown in Vim (too many seductive tools for viewing / editing). <br>- Writing raw HTML: also would work but too much cognitive load. <br>- Blogger / WordPress / choose-your-own-blog-service: I was concerned I wouldn't understand the abstractions from first principles, or that by the time I did they'd have shifted significantly under my feet. Also, would have to convert my static site onto some kind of hosted service.<br><br>Next steps will be adding footnote support to the Text content block - also may write a LabScript parser in OCaml / some functional language as a nice contrast to my hacky implementation in Ruby. <br><br>[0] github link here<br></p>

    <h2>Lab notes kickoff</h2>
    <h4>2022-03-14</h4>

    <p><br>Kicking off my lab notebook with this post. This was inspired by Nelson Elhage's insight that [0], unlike other scientists, many (most?) software engieers don't keep lab notebooks. Also Andy Mustuchak's notion of "working with the garage door up." [1]<br><br>I'm writing this collection of notes for my own consumption - the words "I don't know" will be constant, and most posts will be of works in progress. It's also going to force me to write the words - which is something I definitely need to improve<br><br>Cheers! <br><br>[0] link to post here<br>[1] link to post here<br></p>
