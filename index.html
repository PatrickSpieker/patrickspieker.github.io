    <p>Some things I believe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Everything is ultimately about allocating time or money to attempt to
        solve problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to choose what to reveal is critical for personal identity.
      </li>
      <li>Controlling your environment makes you happy</li>
      <li>Finish or recap past events before moving on.</li>
      <li>To become close with others, work - together.</li>
    </ul>
